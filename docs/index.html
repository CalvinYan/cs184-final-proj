  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <!-- Provide us a descriptive title, 2-3 sentences that summarize your project, and list your three team members. -->
  <p>Our project focus on demonstrating some 2-D or 3-D renderings by augmented reality. We use the QR code as a mark so that we
    can locate the area and plane to render models on, then we can add some cool special effect(dynamic lighting, live model
    and animation) on the real world through computer vision and computer graphics.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <!-- Here you should provide the context for your idea. Describe the problem that you are trying to solve, why it is 
    important, where it is challenging. Give us a general idea on how you are going to solve it. -->

  <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
  <!-- This is the most important part of your proposal. You should carefully think through what you are trying to accomplish, what results you are going for, and why you think you can accomplish those goals. For example:
    Since this is a graphics class you will likely define the kind of images you will create (e.g. including a photo of a new lighting effect you will simulate).
    If you are working on an interactive system, describe what demo you will create.
    Define how you will measure the quality / performance of your system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or quantifying accuracy). It may not be possible to define precise target metrics at this time, but we encourage you to try.
    What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?
    You should break this section into two parts: (1) what you plan to deliver, and (2) what you hope to deliver. In (1), describe what you believe you must accomplish to have a successful project and achieve the grade you expect (i.e. your baseline plan -- planning for some unexpected problems would make sense). In (2), describe what you hope to achieve if things go well and you get ahead of schedule (your aspirational plan). -->
    <h3>What we plan to deliver?</h3>
    <p>Making a vedio demo about our augmented reality, the demo will including the whole process, including locating the 
      QR code, find the rendering plane and our 3D model on it.
    </p>
    <h3>What we hope to deliver?</h3>
    <p>
      Augmented reality is, at its core, an interactive medium, giving the user an immersive visual experience in real
      time. We wish to produce an interactive demo wherein, but this remains a stretch goal due to the immense
      challenges it entails. We would have to develop a mobile application for our project and optimize rendering very
      heavily to allow for high frame frates (all the while using less powerful hardware!)
    </p>
    <p>Further than 3D model, we want to try something new. For example, some animation as shown in the youtube vedio.Or making 
      it more genral, not limited to the QR code, so that we can do something like a real time shoes wearing for advertisement.
    </p>

    <p>I thought the most important and difficult part is how to combine the computer graphics rendering skill with the computer vision
      together. More specifically, that is about how to recognize the QR code first, then use the recognition result to convey the 
      position and height message with the tilt angle for the following rendering part.
      <bm>
      There is no qualitative analysis for our project so far, maybe we will consider the rendering speed later. At this time, 
      We thought that the most effective and convenient way is to watch the vedio and check the quality of the image or 3D model
      by eye bowls. It's easy to tell whether that is cool or not.
    </p>
    

    1.the AR position is stable, how to add stability?
    2. How we gonna do the render? About the combination of these 

    1. Detect QR code
    2. Overlay 2d
    3. Overlay 3d
    4. More complex 3d
    5. Rendering speedup / Complex rendering 
 
  <h2>Schedule</h2>
  <!-- In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week. -->
  <p>
    1.QR code detection (4.4-4.11)
    2.rendering 2D image on a pre-recorded video (4.11-4.18)
    3.rendering 3D image (4.18-4.25)
    4.rendering 3D in live camera (4.25-presentation)

  </p>
  <h2>Resources</h2>
  <!-- List what resources, e.g. books, papers and/or online resources that are references for your project. List the computing platform, hardware and software resources that you will use for your project. You have a wide latitude here to use what you have access to, but be aware that you will have to support and trouble-shoot on your platform yourselves. If you are starting from an existing piece of code or system, describe and provide a pointer to it here.

  <p>
    We will use the work of Ian Curtis, going by the alias "XRArchitect" online, as an (admittedly ambitious) benchmark
    for the quality of our final product. You can view his work on his <a href="https://twitter.com/XRarchitect">Twitter
    </a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ianjcurtis/">Instagram</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, we will use the <a href="https://cal-cs184-student.github.io/project-webpages-sp23-rsha256/proj3-1/index.html">completed path tracer</a> from Project 3-1 as a baseline for 3D rendering.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below are some development tools we will explore and possibly use to achieve our goals:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <a href="https://cal-cs184-student.github.io/project-webpages-sp23-rsha256/proj3-1/index.html">completed path tracer</a> as a baseline for 3D rendering
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop">Google ARCore</a> for mobile development and AR features like
        environmental lighting estimation
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html">OpenCV</a> for fiducial marker 
        tracking and positioning
      </li>
    </ul>
